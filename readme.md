cias - Crestron Is A Scam

I've come across a bunch of old (1080p) crestron AV components.
For ex, dm-md8x8 full of cards, dm-rmc-scalar-c and all sorts of other stuff.

I'd love to use them for HDMI routing. In my casual tests like mouse wiggling etc, the latency is not perceivable.
Cool. The dm-md8x8 can seem to do any mix of any audio or video from any of its input cards to any mix of any audio and
video on any output card, with something like sub 20ms latency.

The crestron ecosystem is awful tho. All of the crestron toolkit, programming tools, resources, are paywalled. Certified
engineers seem motivated to shut down community conversation about how to work with this gear. I can find some crestron 
code on github, but (freely accessible) online discussions are rare and unanswered from what I can find. AV vendors 
sell this hugely expensive locked-off gear and retain rights to the source code, customers are stuck with locked off and
unmodifiable gear, there's no aftermarket because no vendor is motivated to sell used gear and only vendors will be
licensed to access the programming tools anyway. Deep breaths. ok

But, the dm-md8x8 does expose a telnet interface, through which I can make my own front-end and make it do things.

So that's what I'm trying to do here!
